# ysgo-examples

This repository contains a sample project showing how the [ysgo library](https://github.com/RemiEven/ysgo) can be used (here, with the [ebiten library](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten)) to create dialogues in video games.
It is based on the [Choose-Your-Path Game](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/unity-sample-projects/example-project-1) from the Yarn Spinner documentation.

It uses multiple nodes, jump, conditions, options and variables, but no custom functions or commands.

The game can be compiled to native linux/windows executables or to wasm binaries that are playable in itch.io.
